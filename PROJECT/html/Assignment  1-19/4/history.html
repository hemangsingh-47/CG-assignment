  <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus, which dates back to ancient times.
    In the 19th century, <u>Charles Babbage</u> proposed the <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>, a design that laid the foundation for modern computing.
    His collaborator, <em>Ada Lovelace</em>, is considered the first computer programmer.
    Early machines like the <mark>Z3</mark> and ENIAC were massive and used <i>vacuum tubes</i> for processing.
    These machines were limited in speed and reliability, but they marked the <b>beginning of digital computation</b>.
    The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> was a central concept even in these early designs.
    Over time, the idea of programmable machines evolved, leading to the <strong>stored-program architecture</strong> introduced by John von Neumann.

  <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    Computers are often categorized into <b>five generations</b>, each marked by technological breakthroughs.
    The first generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were bulky and prone to failure.
    The second generation introduced <i>transistors</i>, making machines smaller and more efficient.
    The third generation saw the rise of <u>integrated circuits</u>, enabling faster processing.
    By the fourth generation, <em>microprocessors</em> revolutionized computing, making devices <strong>personal and affordable</strong>.
    The fifth generation focuses on <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>, aiming to make machines smarter.
    Throughout these generations, the role of the <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> and <strong>storage devices</strong> has evolved dramatically.
    Today's computers are capable of performing billions of operations per second, thanks to advancements in <code>hardware</code> and <code>software</code>.

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet began as a military project called <u>ARPANET</u> in the late 1960s.
    It was designed to be a <strong>decentralized communication network</strong> that could survive attacks.
    Over time, it expanded to universities and research institutions.
    In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, introducing <code>HTML</code> and the first web browser.
    This innovation transformed the Internet into a <em>global information system</em>.
    As Berners-Lee once said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."
     <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The Internet rapidly grew with the introduction of <mark>email</mark>, <mark>search engines</mark>, and <mark>social media</mark>.
    Today, billions of people use the Internet for <strong>communication</strong>, <em>commerce</em>, and <i>entertainment</i>.
  </p>

  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p>
    In the modern era, computers have become <small>ubiquitous and portable</small>.
    We've moved from <del>dial-up</del> to <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber-optic connections.
    Smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices are now common.
    Cloud computing allows users to store and access data remotely.
    Technologies like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> power dynamic web applications.
    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are driving innovation in fields like healthcare, finance, and education.
    Mathematical formulas are often used in computing, such as:
    <br>
    Energy: E = mc<sup>2</sup><br>
    Water molecule: H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
    Logarithmic complexity: O(log<sub>2</sub>n)
  </p>

  <h2>Computer Example</h2>
  <p>
    Here's a basic example of HTML code to display text on a webpage:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    To copy text, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.<br>
    System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
  </p>
  <p>
    In programming, variables are often declared like this: <code>int <var>x</var>  = 10;</code>
    You can also use <code>console.log(<var>message</var>)</code> to display output in JavaScript.
